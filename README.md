# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for tmux, neovim, and bash.

You'll also notice a `init-server.tar.gz` file here too. This is my Debian based server set up!

If you want to set up a debian based distribution with node, yarn, neovim, tmux, docker, and postgres, this might be a helpful tool for you!

Run this command from your user's home directory.

```bash
wget https://fireninjasfiles.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/init-server.tar.gz && tar xvzf init-server.tar.gz && ./script.sh
```
